Star Wars Battle

Rules: 
Choose your fighter by clicking on one of the characters on this page. 
Once your fighter is chosen, you will decide who they will go up against by clicking on another character. 
Once an Opponent is chosen, click the attack button to do damage to their health! 
Be careful though, as each time you attack, your opponent strikes back! 
Do you have what it takes to make it past all of your opponents? 
Will you fall victim to the darkside?



Found fix to run game smoothly, third opponent is now available to be chosen.

Was not able to restart the game upon winning or losing. Page re-load did the trick.

Please suggest any changes or tips to improve the game.
